- question about `tail, Tail, TAIL`
    - the current approach/solution may have problem?
        - only run `id=++max_id_` once, but push all three strings into `names` arr
    - YES, it really has problem. BUT not totally.
        - `get_id_by_names()` func is WRONG
            - because it breaks the CONVENTION that
                - in `to_string()` func, `literal = aalta_formula::names[oper()]`
        - while the patch in 'aaltaf(d)' is OK.
            - because it runs before `max_id_ = names.size()`
    - NO, it doesn't have any problems indeed.
        - because there is no `max_id_` for names, `id = names.size()` in `get_id_by_name(s)()` funcs
        - although, I still changes the codes of `get_id_by_names()` func

- [ ] First, test advanced cases in old codes of `simplify()` func
- [ ] Then, try to identify `(!Tail) U a & (!Tail) U (!a)` to UNSAT
    - It's unnecessary, as it won't be input directly!!!
