- `blsc` has BUG or is incomplete, it can't cope with `false` -> UNSAT
- my plan is: stop `blsc` temporarily, do CDLSC first and then adapt the method from CDLSC to `blsc`
- now, I have found that `CDLSC` still couldn't cope with many cases without `simplify()` func
    - maybe it just couldn't copy with `tail` literal, which is not a formal literal
        - try to find more proofs or counterexamples
    - and the `simplify()` func is so complex that I think it's just a bad patch to make the whole program runs successfully
        - As there is no statements in paper AAAI2019
        - Is there any other approaches to archieve/implement a simpler `simplify()`?
        - Or can I bypass/skip it?
        - If continue to use the old codes of `simplify()`, there is a big problem that I couldn't stand/bear that there is a black box without godd interface in my codes/program.
- add plenty of printfs to see why `(!Tail) U a & (!Tail) U (!a)` is SAT now
    - may about `simplify()` func
    - NOTE: use simple case `(!Tail & b) U b` to write printfs successfully and then debug `(!Tail) U a & (!Tail) U (!a)`
