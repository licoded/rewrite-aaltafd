- we just need to ensure that the id of formula f to be checked is the biggest
    - then since the solver we use is different, so everything else is OK
- `a` /\ `a -> b` -> `b`, while `!a` /\ `a->b` -> empty
    - it's cunning/subtly!
- there is ~~something different~~ in the codes to the paper!
    - previous understanding is wrong, some details are omitted/misunderstood
    - BUT still with serval problems left about the `get_uc()` func.
