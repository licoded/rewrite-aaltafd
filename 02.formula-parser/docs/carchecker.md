- we just need to ensure that the id of formula f to be checked is the biggest
    - then since the solver we use is different, so everything else is OK
- `a` /\ `a -> b` -> `b`, while `!a` /\ `a->b` -> empty
    - it's cunning/subtly!
- there is something different in the codes to the paper!
    - `ψ = C[frame level] = /\ uc[i]` instead of `ψ = ¬X(C[frame level])`
