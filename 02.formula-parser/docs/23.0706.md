## TODOs

### performance 

- all cases (number:50) executed successfully after run of a night
    - a good news, may be there is already no mistakes/BUGs when copying/rewriting codes
- but why so bad performance
    - cout(s)/prints may highly block/slow the I/O, so as to make performance worse
        - but I have remote these cout(s)/prints
        - and I think the for loop(s) and other codes to record infos to read when debug just have little effect/impact
    - the `simplify()` may have a huge effect/impact
        - let's just copy it later!!!
    - I think `check_with_heuristics()` also just has little effect/impact
        - But we need do/take a experiment to prove it
            - remove `check_with_heuristics()` from old codes and test!!!
    - other influencing/interfering factor(s)
        - e.g. small opts I have done
            - just recall... maybe find from git comments!!!

### important

- [ ] move new `Makefile` to old codes to accelelrate the compilation speed
- [x] remove `check_with_heuristics()` from old codes and test
    - has done, almost no impact, still very quick
- [x] copy `simplify()` from old codes directly and test
    - just DON't NEED, 3min -- 50 complex UNSAT cases, this speed is enough
    - now 27s -- 50 complex UNSAT cases, after removing all `to_string()` and `couts/prints`
- [ ] study/examine benchmarks, run it grouply/automaticly, to check the **correctness**
    - NOTE: **correctness** is in the first place now, not speed
- [ ] understand what `coi` and `coi_map_` mean and do
- [ ] add `evidence` for new codes. It should be very simple.
