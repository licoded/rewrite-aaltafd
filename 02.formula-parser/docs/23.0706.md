## TODOs

### performance 

- all cases (number:50) executed successfully after run of a night
    - a good news, may be there is already no mistakes/BUGs when copying/rewriting codes
- but why so bad performance
    - cout(s)/prints may highly block/slow the I/O, so as to make performance worse
        - but I have remote these cout(s)/prints
        - and I think the for loop(s) and other codes to record infos to read when debug just have little effect/impact
    - the `simplify()` may have a huge effect/impact
        - let's just copy it later!!!
    - I think `check_with_heuristics()` also just has little effect/impact
        - But we need do/take a experiment to prove it
            - remove `check_with_heuristics()` from old codes and test!!!
    - other influencing/interfering factor(s)
        - e.g. small opts I have done
            - just recall... maybe find from git comments!!!

### important

- [ ] move new `Makefile` to old codes to accelelrate the compilation speed
- [ ] remove `check_with_heuristics()` from old codes and test
- [ ] copy `simplify()` from old codes directly and test
- [ ] understand what `coi` and `coi_map_` mean and do
- [ ] add `evidence` for new codes. It should be very simple.
